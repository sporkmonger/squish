Squish is a classifier based on probabilistic finite state models.  It
effectively implements most of the DMC compression algorithm.  In essence,
it creates several different compression models, one for each classification
"bucket".  To train an input into a bucket, you simply traverse the model,
and increment the counter for each transition, cloning states as you would
in DMC.  To classify an input, you calculate the compression ratios of the
input when compressed by the model of each bucket, selecting the best
compression model as the classification.

Squish is written in OCaml and is highly experimental.
