Squish is a classifier based on probabilistic finite state models.  It
effectively implements most of the DMC compression algorithm.  In essence,
it creates several different compression models, one for each classification
"bucket".  To train an input into a bucket, you simply traverse the model,
and increment the counter for each transition, cloning states as you would
in DMC.  To classify an input, you calculate the probability of the input
for each bucket by traversing the model and getting the product of all of
the individual transition probabilities.

Squish is written in OCaml and is highly experimental.
